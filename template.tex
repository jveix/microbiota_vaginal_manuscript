\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Experimental Design}
This study recruited Mexican women aged 18--45 years from gynecological consultations at ABC Medical Center. Participants were divided into two groups: cases and controls. Cases were women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), defined as at least four episodes in the past 12 months, while controls were healthy women attending routine annual Pap smear consultations without a history of recurrent vaginitis. 

Inclusion criteria for both groups required abstinence from sexual activity for 48 hours, no menstruation at the time of sample collection, no antibiotic use in the previous three months, and no diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or immunosuppressive disorders. Cases were additionally required to have a history of RVVC, while controls were limited to a history of one or fewer vaginitis episodes over their lifetime. Participants provided informed consent after receiving a detailed explanation of the study.

Exclusion criteria included conditions contrary to the inclusion parameters, such as menstruation during sample collection, recent antibiotic use, or declining to participate. Controls were excluded if they had symptoms of vaginitis within the past six months or a history of more than one vaginitis episode diagnosed as vulvovaginal candidiasis. Cases were excluded if they did not meet the threshold for RVVC episodes or if they were outside the specified age range.

\subsection{Vaginal Swab Sampling}
Participants were positioned on a gynecological examination table with stirrups, and a vaginal speculum was inserted for sample collection. Cervicovaginal mucus was collected using Catch-All‚Ñ¢ Sample Collection Swabs (Epicentre, Illumina) from the vaginal fornix. The vaginal pH was measured using Hydrion pH test strips (MicroEssential). The swab was then placed in a 2 mL tube containing sterile PBS solution, trimmed to fit, and stored at 4$^\circ$ C until DNA extraction.

\subsection{DNA Extraction from Vaginal Swab Samples}
DNA was extracted from vaginal swab samples using the GeneAll Exgene‚Ñ¢ Stool SV Kit (GeneAll). Samples were first centrifuged for 5 minutes at 6000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS buffer, vortexed for 1 minute, and incubated at room temperature for 30 seconds. After centrifugation at maximum speed for 2 minutes, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1.3 mL of Buffer FL, incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature, and centrifuged at $\geq$10,000 $\times g$ for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to an EzPass‚Ñ¢ filter column, centrifuged, and eluted into a clean 1.5 mL tube with 100 ¬µL of Buffer EB. After further purification steps involving Buffer PB and Buffer NW, the final DNA elution was performed with 50 ¬µL of Buffer EB. DNA integrity and concentration were verified using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and 0.5\% agarose gel electrophoresis.

\subsection{Amplification of 16S Ribosomal Gene (V3 and V4 Regions)}
The presence of bacterial DNA in vaginal swab samples was confirmed by amplifying the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reaction conditions and primers followed the protocols detailed in Tables 3 and 4, with a final reaction volume of 50 ¬µL per sample.

\emph{Escherichia coli} SK10019 was used as a positive control for bacterial DNA, and a reaction mix without template DNA served as the negative control. Amplifications were carried out using a GeneAmp\textregistered~PCR System 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were resolved on 2\% agarose gels stained with Midori Green Advanced dye, using TBE buffer. A molecular weight marker of 100 bp (Fermentas\textregistered) was included. Electrophoresis was conducted at 90 V for 50 minutes, and gels were imaged using a Molecular Imager\textregistered~Gel Doc\texttrademark~XR system (Bio-Rad).

\subsection{Library Preparation for the V3 Region of the 16S rRNA Gene}
Bacterial DNA presence was confirmed in vaginal samples, followed by library preparation targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. A unique barcode sequence and sequencing adapters were incorporated using PCR under conditions detailed in Tables 5 and 6. Amplicon quality was verified via 2.0\% agarose gel electrophoresis. Products of $\sim$281 bp were identified, and large-scale PCR was performed to increase product yield.

Equal concentrations of PCR products were pooled and further purified from preparative agarose gels using the Wizard\textregistered~SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Final amplicon size ($\sim$281 bp) and DNA concentration were validated by analytical 2.0\% agarose gel electrophoresis.

\subsection{Amplification of the V5 Region of the 18S rRNA Gene}
To detect yeast DNA, analytical PCR targeting the V5 region of the 18S rRNA gene was performed using high-fidelity Takara Ex Taq polymerase under conditions described in Tables 7 and 8. \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} S2886 served as a positive control, and a no-template reaction served as a negative control. Products were analyzed via 2.0\% agarose gel electrophoresis.

\subsection{Species Diagnosis of \emph{Candida} via PCR Amplification}
To determine the etiology of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) in case subjects and detect the presence of \emph{Candida} in control subjects, PCR reactions were performed using species-specific primers for \emph{C. albicans} and \emph{C. glabrata}. These species were selected based on epidemiological prevalence, and primers for \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} were included due to its potential role in vulvovaginitis, which clinically resembles \emph{Candida} infections. 

Primers for \emph{C. albicans} and \emph{C. glabrata} targeted the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region, as described by Luo and Mitchell (2002). \emph{S. cerevisiae} primers targeted the MEX67 gene, involved in mRNA nuclear export, following methods described by Muir et al. (2011). PCR reactions used high-fidelity Takara Ex Taq polymerase with conditions and primer sequences detailed in Tables 10--13. Positive controls included \emph{C. albicans} ATCC, \emph{C. glabrata} CBS138, and \emph{S. cerevisiae} S2886, while negative controls used reaction mixtures without DNA templates. 

Amplicons were resolved via 2.0\% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with Midori Green Advanced dye, and products were visualized using the Molecular Imager\textregistered~Gel Doc\texttrademark~XR system (Bio-Rad). Amplicon sizes were confirmed against a 100 bp molecular weight marker. 

PCR products were cloned using the GeneJET\texttrademark~PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher), and plasmid DNA was extracted for capillary sequencing with pJET1 primers. Resulting sequences were analyzed using VECTOR NTI Advance\texttrademark~and BLAST alignments to verify species-specific diagnostic accuracy. Figures 14--16 depict the pJET1.2blunt vector and the cloned sequences of each amplified product.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Distinct Microbial Profiles and Candida Prevalence in Vaginosis Cases vs. Controls}

In this study, 38 controls and 57 cases met the inclusion criteria, of which 25 controls and 48 cases were successfully sequenced (Table~\ref{stab:seq_sum}). No significant differences were observed between groups regarding age, age at menarche, age of sexual life start, or vaginal pH, with other variables showing similar distributions between the groups (Figure~\ref{sfig:qqplot}). Notably, a subset of participants had used antibiotics (30.95\% of cases and 43.86\% of controls), and this factor was accounted for in subsequent analyses. Additionally, qPCR detection revealed significant differences in the prevalence of \textit{Candida albicans} (90\% in cases vs. 36.17\% in controls) and \textit{Candida glabrata} (0\% in cases vs. 97.87\% in controls) based on two-proportion z-tests (Table~\ref{tab:metadata}, Figure~\ref{fig:metadata}).

\subsection{Antibiotic Intake and Patient Condition Have a Small Effect on Beta Diversity}

Sequencing data were processed as outlined in the Methods section. For samples with low sequencing depth, re-sequencing was performed, and the resulting reads were combined by summation (Figure~\ref{sfig:sample_sums}). 

To investigate the impact of antibiotic use and patient condition on global bacterial diversity, both alpha and beta diversity metrics were analyzed. While alpha diversity appeared unaffected by these factors, beta diversity showed significant associations based on ADONIS tests. Weighted beta diversity was influenced primarily by patient condition (\textit{p} = 0.042), whereas unweighted beta diversity was significantly associated with both patient condition (\textit{p} = 0.012) and antibiotic use (\textit{p} = 0.018). Despite these findings, the low $R^2$ values indicate that the observed effects are small (Figure~\ref{fig:diversity}). 

Additionally, sequencing depth was examined in relation to antibiotic consumption to determine whether it contributed to a reduction in read counts; however, no evidence of such an effect was found (Figure~{\ref{sfig:counts_ant}}).

ADONIS was applied in order to account for the variance explained by Condition (\textit{p} = 0.036, $R^{2}$ = 0.05) and Antibiotic intake (\textit{p} = 0.39, $R^{2}$ = 0.01). \textbf{C.} Scatter plot showing Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for unweighted Unifrac distance for beta diversity assesing in the groups.

\subsection{Vaginal Microbiota Composition Reflects Patient Condition and Antibiotic Use}

The composition of the vaginal microbiota was analyzed at both the phylum and genus levels to identify changes in key bacterial taxa across samples. Hierarchical clustering using weighted beta diversity was employed to compare taxa and assess similarities among bacterial communities in the groups.

Samples were first grouped by antibiotic intake and subsequently by patient condition. Significant alterations were observed in the \textit{Firmicutes} ratio, particularly between cases and controls. Cases without antibiotic use exhibited the highest abundance of \textit{Bacteroidota} and \textit{Actinobacteriota}, whereas controls who had taken antibiotics were dominated by the \textit{Firmicutes\_D} phylum.

At the genus level, \textit{Firmicutes\_D} was predominantly represented by \textit{Lactobacillus}, which also dominated controls with antibiotic use. In contrast, cases without antibiotic intake showed a higher prevalence of \textit{Bifidobacterium}, while  \textit{Bacteroides\_H} was found only in controls who had not taken antibiotics. Notably, \textit{Fannyhessea} was characteristic of cases without antibiotic use, whereas \textit{Sneathia} was specific to cases with antibiotic use.

Additionally, a marked increase in \textit{Prevotella} was observed in cases where \textit{Lactobacillus} was replaced by a diverse array of low-abundance taxa (<2\%, grouped as "Other"). These findings highlight the dynamic shifts in microbial composition associated with antibiotic use and patient condition (Figure~{\ref{fig:relab}}).

	\label{fig:relab}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{\textit{Lactobacillus} and Other Key Bacterial Biomarkers Are Associated with a Healthy Vaginal Microbiota}

To identify bacterial biomarkers associated with vaginosis, we performed differential abundance analyses while accounting for antibiotic intake. Two approaches were used: ALDEx2, with the formula $y \sim$ antibiotic intake + condition, and linear discriminant analysis (LEfSe), using condition as the class variable and antibiotic intake as the subclass.

The results from ALDEx2 are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:differential}A, with corresponding square root-transformed relative abundance values shown in Figure~\ref{fig:differential}B. In the control group, \textit{Lactobacillus} and an unassigned taxon were prominent. Interestingly, two distinct ASVs classified as \textit{Escherichia\_710834} were identified in both the control and case groups.

LEfSe results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:differential}C, with the corresponding square root-transformed relative abundance values in Figure~\ref{fig:differential}D. These findings corroborated the ALDEx2 results for \textit{Lactobacillus}. Additionally, \textit{Prevotella}, \textit{Limosilactobacillus}, \textit{Streptococcus}, and \textit{Dialister} were predominant in controls, whereas two distinct \textit{Escherichia\_710834} ASVs, unassigned taxa, and \textit{Cutibacterium} were characteristic of cases.

\section{Discussion}

The aim of this work was to characterize the vaginal microbiota of women suffering from RVVC. We found no differences between cases and control in women associated metadata. For instance, no differences in vaginal pH were consistent with the disease diagnosis \cite{@sobelVulvovaginalCandidosis2007}. The age prevalence in women is also consistent with literature which indicates that most of episodes occur between 19 to 35 years with lower prevalence rates after 50 years \cite{@blosteinRecurrentVulvovaginalCandidiasis2017}, though we observed a broader range between 20 to 50 years, with most of the cases being around 35. Additionally, a moderate association with RVVC incidence and new sexual partners has been reported \cite{@yanoCurrentPatientPerspectives2019}, in our work, there is a tendency of cases having more sexual partners, but our results are not conclusive in that matter.

In this work, we detected by qPCR, \textit{Candida albicans} exclusive to RVVC cases, while \textit{Candida glabrata} was found in higher proportion in the control group. Interestingly, some literature mentions \textit{Candida albicans} to be the major cause of infection, with 80-95\% of isolates identified as this species \cite{@sobelVulvovaginalCandidosis2007a}, though somo other species such as \textit{Candida glabrata}, \textit{Candida tropicalis}, and \textit{Candida parapsilosis} are now frequently identified as human pathogens \cite{@silvaCandidaGlabrataCandida2012}. Moreover, \textit{Candida} spp. have been previously isolated for healthy women \cite{@goldacreVaginalMicrobialFlora1979; @chowVaginalColonizationEscherichia1986}, and it has been reported that \textit{Candida} infections are in fact common and in most of the cases occurs in healthy individuals \cite{@gowImportanceCandidaAlbicans2012}, so there might be an effect of the vaginal bacteria in our patients, which will be explored further.

It was also interesting, for the scope of this study, that a significant portion of both group took antibiotics during this study, as it has been observed previously that intake of broad-spectrum antibiotics might reduce the gut microbiota diversity \cite{@dubourgCulturomicsPyrosequencingEvidence2014}. For this reason, we had to include antibiotics intake into account when evaluating the bacterial profile.

We found no major differences in alpha diversity between cases and controls in our work. However, a small effect was observed due to both antibiotic intake and RVVC. As mentioned before, is expected that antibiotics have an impact in diversity, also in the context of vaginal microbiota, long-term might develop resistance and cause recurrent infections \cite{@lev-sagieVaginalMicrobiomeTransplantation2019}. Overall, the diversity in all groups was low, which is expected in the case of vaginal microbiota \cite{@sunVulvovaginalCandidiasisVaginal2023}. Previous reports evaluating microbial diversity during RVVC condition found major differences in alpha and beta diversity, with lower diversity in the cases \cite{@ceccaraniDiversityVaginalMicrobiome2019; @liuDiverseVaginalMicrobiomes2013}.



Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) infection is an example of a disease brought about directly through antibiotic disruption of the gut microbiota /\cite{@theriotAntibioticinducedShiftsMouse2014}
